# GreyNoise_IP_Hunt
This project was related to a script I wrote that takes GreyNoise data and formats it for Microsoft Defender.

It is fairly simple to run. Just execute the script in your IDE of choice, put in the tag you are interested in, and the size of the query (API limits at 10k).

After, it will write the data for it to be pasted in Defender. Feel free to write the queries for your EDR of choice or build off the code how you like!

I'm active on the GreyNoise Community Slack & Twitter @RoddSec!
